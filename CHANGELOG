1.4.5:
    - Property: assign_spacing.  If False, remove spacing around assignment
      operator.  Thanks to Balthasar Reuter (@reuterbal).
    - Documentation update

1.4.4:
    - Bugfix: patch() and update() now work with Cogroups.  To specify a
      particular cogroup, use the `_index` meta key in the patch.  Otherwise,
      the patch is applied to all members of the cogroup.
      Thanks to @mandresm and @seb-wahl for reporting and collaborating on the
      design.
    - Multidimensional negative index support
    - patch no longer pops off values applied to the namelist
      Thanks to Armin Corbin and Claire Carouge for reporting.
    - Improved NumPy (and xarray) compatibility through introduction
      Thanks to Liam Pattinson for contributing this fix.

1.4.3:
    - Bugfix: Cogroup namelist initialization from a cogroup was fixed.
      Thanks to Rasmus Fogh for reporting.

1.4.2:
    - Bugfix: Case-insensitive del now works as intended.
      Thanks to GitHub user @mandresm for reporting.

1.4.1:
    - Bugfix: Several cogroup issues related to management of internal keys and
      todict() output were fixed.  Thanks to GitHub user @poluhh and Rasmus H.
      Fogh for reporting.
    - Bugfix: Empty lists [] are now displayed as comma-delimited blanks.
      Thanks to William Dawson for reporting.

1.4:
    - Ordering of duplicate keys is now preserved, through the introduction of
      two new classes.  The Cogroup extends the list previously associated with
      the values of a duplicate key.  The NmlKey extends str and externally
      holds the namelist key, but also contains an internal key to distinguish
      between duplicates.
    - A repeated key is no longer initialized with a list, and must now be
      explicitly declared as a cogroup with the `add_cogroup` function.
    - A performance issue related to the detection of values in a line has been
      fixed.  Thanks to Stephen LeDoux for reporting and Philip Cross for
      fixing this issue.

1.3.1:
    - String splitting is now an optional feature, enabled by the split_strings
      property.  Default string array output again resembles v1.2 output.
    - Bugfix: For arrays of strings, a split string element will no longer
      insert erroneous commas.  Thanks to Jared Lewis for reporting.

1.3:
    - Strings which exceed the column limit are now split across multiple
      lines.  Thanks to Xi Chen for reporting.
    - We now raise ValueError if we reach and EOF before a namelist group has
      been terminated.  It is also raised for various StopIteration scenarios.
    - Namelist output with repeated values can now use repeat tokens if
      enabled.  Thanks to Holger Wolff for contributing this feature.
    - Bugfix: Preserve newlines in the reads() string parser.  This fixes a bug
      in the handling of tokens outside of namelist groups.  Thanks to GitHub
      user @coreur for reporting.
    - Patching now supports the addition of new namelist groups.  Thanks to
      Cory Kramer for reporting and suggesting this issue.

1.2:
    - Bugfix: Repeated null arrays as final elements now parse correctly.
    - Bugfix: Preprossor comment token # now correctly disabled on default.
    - Bugfix: Several indexing issues with array patching have been fixed.
    - Improved "duck typing" tokenization of numerics and other data types,
    - Removal of Namelist constructor calls in __setitem__.

1.1.2:
    - README update to remove `-e` flags for local installs.

1.1.1:
    - YAML: Additional install support (f90nml[yaml]) package and additional
      documentation for supporting YAML conversion.
    - Bugfix: Removal of `-o` output flag.  The positional argument is now used
      exclusively to set the output file in the CLI.
    - Documentation changes and integration, thanks to the JOSS reviewers.

1.1:
    - Bugfix: Out-of-order multidimensional support now works correctly.
    - Bugfix: Derived type list updates without an index now correctly apply
      the update to the first element in the list.  Thanks to GitHub user
      @LSchueler for reporting.
    - Bugfix: `Namelist.todict` now correctly copies the contents of
      user-defined types as sub-namelists.  Thanks to @kripnerl for reporting.
    - Improved IEEE NaN and Inf support, thanks to @jensss for reporting.
    - Strings can now be parsed as namelists using `Parser.reads()`.
    - Spacing between indices is now disabled on default, and optionally
      enabled using the `index_spacing` control flag.  This spacing is
      supported in most compilers, but it also violates the behaviour as
      defined in the standard.  Thanks to Robert Schweppe for reporting and
      Themos Tsikas at NAG for the explanation.
    - Metadata support for indentation...
    - `Namelist.groups()` provides an iterator for spanning the namelist groups
      and variable names.  Thanks to Jens Svensmark for contributing this
      feature.
    - Improved command line flag help, thanks to Warrick Bell.
    - Improved various warning logging, thanks to Pascal Hebbeker.
    - Exception fixes and various style cleanups, thanks to Qi Zhang.

1.0.2:
    - Automated manpage build has been removed from setup.py due to potential
      conflicts with Sphinx.  Manpage support is now expected to be handled
      within individual distributions.  Thanks to Adrien Morrison for
      reporting.

1.0.1:
    - Manifest update to include tests, which are now a required component of
      the setup.py script.  Thanks to Andrew Kiss for reporting.

1.0:
    - Multidimensional arrays are now padded with null values on default.
      Values are now square-like and should safely convert to NumPy arrays.
      Thanks to Caoxiang Zhu for suggesting this change.
    - strict_logical and row_major arguments were removed from the top-level
      API functions.  They are now controlled by Parser objects.
    - Parser floatformat changed to float_format
    - Parser colwidth changed to column_width
    - default_start_index added to Namelist for explicit start index.
      `default_start_index` can also be set via the constructor, in order to
      initialise dicts as Namelists.  Thanks to GitHub user @gitporst for
      suggesting this feature.
    - Many Namelist and Parser attributes converted to type-safe properties
    - Most internal Namelist and Parser functions tagged as private
    - Test suite now invoked by `setup.py test`.
    - `decomplex` flag of `todict` renamed to `complex_tuple`
    - Appveyor (Windows) test support
    - Extensive documentation update and sphinx integration
    - Manpage installation by setup.py for CLI (if Sphinx is available)
    - Bugfix: Namelist() now works with arrays of dtypes as nested dicts.
      Thanks to GitHub users @gitporst and @sound-fx for reporting.
    - Bugfix: Namelist() now works with multidimensional arrays as list of
      lists.  Thanks to GitHub user @sound-fx for reporting.

v0.23:
    - CLI: Thorough support for JSON, YAML, updating, and patching
    - Namelist method `todict` for conversion to native Python dict
    - User-friendly print() output for namelist files
    - Most CLI features are integrated into the test suite
    - Bugfix: Content outside of namelist groupss are now tokenized as
        comments.  (Thanks to Martin Margo for reporting.)
    - Bugfix: String line continuation under the new tokenizer.  (Thanks to
        Robert Gieseke for reporting.)
    - Bugfix: Entries longer than colwidth no longer append commas, unless
        end_comma is specified
    - Bugfix: Complex lists are now parsed correctly.
    - Bugfix: Constructor now preserves start_index
    - Bugfix: f90str is now more unicode/str (2.x/3.x) compatible

v0.22:
    - A command line interface has been added, see `f90nml -h` for details.
    - We now use a native Python tokenizer, and no longer use shlex.  This has
      led to some modest performance speedups.
    - JSON and YAML files can now be read as namelists, and vice versa.
    - Bugfix: Repeated values in arrays were incorrectly applied to subsequent
      list elements (e.g. y = 5*1, 2, 3 was applying 5 to all three explicit
      elements, instead of just the first).  Thanks to @fizzysister for
      reporting.
    - Bugfix: Dicts can once again be assigned to namelist groups.  (James
      Penn)
    - Namelist patching using a second namelist (James Penn)
    - Sorted namelist field output.  (Andrew Kiss)
    - Documentation typos were fixed, and some docstrings have been cleaned up.

v0.21:
    - Several bug fixes related to derived types and start index tracking
    - Stricter checks for existing parent when modifying a derived type
    - When parsing lists of nested derived types, we now correctly set the
      parent as the respective list element, rather than the entire list.  This
      allows us to remove several redundant code checks from the parser.

v0.20:
    - Indexing is no longer assumed to be 1-based.  The initial index is now
      implicit if unspecifed in the namelist file.  Properties have been added
      to control the index base.
    - Patching a vector with a shorter vector now correctly removes the old
      tail values.
    - Derived type patching is now supported.

v0.19:
    - Array patching is now supported
    - NumPy primitives can be converted to Fortran types
    - File objects can now be used as input arguments

v0.18:
    - File object read and write support
    - Escape (\) character support in strings
    - Fortran floating point `E` symbol is now optional (with +/- exponent)

v0.17:
    - `f90nml.write()` works for normal (non-`Namelist`) dicts
    - `Parser` properties moved outside of function arguments, and are now
      handled with property decorators (as in `Namelist`)
    - Namelists built from (unsorted) dicts are now pre-sorted by key

v0.16:
    - User-defined comment delimiters (e.g. `#` comment support)

v0.15:
    - Null values are now always followed by commas

v0.14:
    - Default logical parsing is now more strict.  Only `true`, `false`, `t`,
      and `f` (and with surrounding `.`) are now parsed to equivalent values.
    - Extensive documentation update

v0.13:
    - Multidimensional array support

v0.12:
    - Namelist output formatting (column width, indent, etc.)
    - Improved user-defined type output support
    - Arch (AUR) distribution configuration
    - Setuptools is now the install default

v0.1--0.11:
    - Lost to history
